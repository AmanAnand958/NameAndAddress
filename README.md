# Name and Address Database

A full-stack application with a Flask backend and a React (Vite) frontend.

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: Flask API and SQLite database.
- `frontend/`: React application with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.
- `start.sh`: Helper script to run both backend and frontend concurrently.

## Getting Started

1.  **Backend**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python app.py
    ```
2.  **Frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

Alternatively, use the `start.sh` script to run everything at once.
